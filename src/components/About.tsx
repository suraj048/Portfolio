            Motivated Front-End Development intern with a strong understanding
            of responsive design and user experience. Iâ€™m passionate about
            learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way
            to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building
            front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am
            a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe
            that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but
            choosing the best tool for the job.
